    <description>
Ludusavi is a tool for backing up your PC video game save data,
written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).
It is cross-platform and supports multiple game stores.

## Features
* Ability to back up data from more than 10,000 games plus your own custom entries.
* Backup and restore for Steam as well as other game libraries.
* Both a graphical interface and command line interface for scripting.
  Tab completion is available for Bash, Fish, Zsh, PowerShell, and Elvish.
* Support for:
  * Saves that are stored as files and in the Windows registry.
  * Proton saves with Steam.
  * Steam screenshots.
* Available as a [Playnite](https://playnite.link) extension:
  https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi-playnite
* Works on the Steam Deck.
  * For desktop mode, set the `WINIT_X11_SCALE_FACTOR` environment variable to `1`.

This tool uses the [Ludusavi Manifest](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi-manifest)
for info on what to back up, and it will automatically download the latest version of
the primary manifest. The data is ultimately sourced from [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Home),
so please contribute any new or fixed data back to the wiki itself, and your
improvements will be incorporated into Ludusavi's data as well.

If you'd like to help translate Ludusavi into other languages,

## Usage

For Usage, see https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/blob/$tag/README.md

## Configuration
Ludusavi stores its configuration in the following locations:

* Windows: `%APPDATA%/ludusavi`
* Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ludusavi` or `~/.config/ludusavi`
* Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/ludusavi`

Alternatively, if you'd like Ludusavi to store its configuration in the same
place as the executable, then simply create a file called `ludusavi.portable`
in the directory that contains the executable file. You might want to do that
if you're going to run Ludusavi from a flash drive on multiple computers.

If you're using the GUI, then it will automatically update the config file
as needed, so you don't need to worry about its content. However, if you're
using the CLI exclusively, then you'll need to edit `config.yaml` yourself.

Ludusavi also stores `manifest.yaml` (info on what to back up) here.
You should not modify that file, because Ludusavi will overwrite your changes
whenever it downloads a new copy.</description>
