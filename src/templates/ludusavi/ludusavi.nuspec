    <description>## Package Parameters
* `/OpenGL` - Install OpenGL flavored support variant instead of native DirectX support.

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/ludusavi)](https://crates.io/crates/ludusavi)

Ludusavi is a tool for backing up your PC video game save data,
written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).
It is cross-platform and supports multiple game stores.

## Features
* Ability to back up data from more than 7,000 games plus your own custom entries.
* Backup and restore for Steam as well as other game libraries.
* Preview of the backup/restore before actually performing it.
* Both a graphical interface and command line interface for scripting.
  Tab completion is available for Bash, Fish, Zsh, PowerShell, and Elvish.
* Support for:
  * Saves that are stored as files and in the Windows registry.
  * Proton saves with Steam.
  * Steam screenshots.
* Available as a [Playnite](https://playnite.link) extension:
  https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi-playnite

This tool uses the [Ludusavi Manifest](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi-manifest)
for info on what to back up, and it will automatically download the latest version of
the primary manifest. The data is ultimately sourced from [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Home),
so please contribute any new or fixed data back to the wiki itself, and your
improvements will be incorporated into Ludusavi's data as well.

## Demo
### GUI

### CLI

## Requirements
Ludusavi is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac. However, your computer must
support one of these graphics systems: Vulkan, DirectX (11 or 12), or Metal.
(Experimental builds with OpenGL support are also available - give them a try
if the standard builds don't work on your system.)

## Notes

When you first run Ludusavi, you may see a popup that says
"Windows protected your PC", because Windows does not recognize the program's
publisher. Click "more info" and then "run anyway" to start the program.

## Configuration
Ludusavi stores its configuration in `C:/Users/&amp;&lt;your-name&amp;&gt;/.config/ludusavi`.
Alternatively, if you'd like Ludusavi to store its configuration in the same
place as the executable, then simply create a file called `ludusavi.portable`
in the directory that contains the executable file. You might want to do that
if you're going to run Ludusavi from a flash drive on multiple computers.

if you're using the GUI, then it will automatically update the config file
as needed, so you don't need to worry about its content. However, if you're
using the CLI exclusively, then you'll need to edit `config.yaml` yourself.</description>
