## About

Alacritty is a terminal emulator with a strong focus on simplicity and
performance. With such a strong focus on performance, included features are
carefully considered and you can always expect Alacritty to be blazingly fast.
By making sane choices for defaults, Alacritty requires no additional setup.
However, it does allow [configuration](#configuration) of many aspects of the
terminal.

The software is considered to be at a **beta** level of readiness -- there are
a few missing features and bugs to be fixed, but it is already used by many as
a daily driver.

On Windows, Alacritty also requires Microsoft's VC++ redistributable.

For Windows versions older than Windows 10 (October 2018 Update), Alacritty
requires winpty to emulate UNIX's PTY API. The agent is a single binary
(`winpty-agent.exe`) which **must** be in the same directory as the Alacritty
executable.

## Configuration

You can find the default configuration file with documentation for all available
fields on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases) for each release.

Alacritty looks for the configuration file at the following paths:

1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty/alacritty.yml`
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty.yml`
3. `$HOME/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml`
4. `$HOME/.alacritty.yml`

### Windows

On Windows the config file is located at:

`%APPDATA%\alacritty\alacritty.yml`

## Issues (known, unknown, feature requests, etc.)

If you run into a problem with Alacritty, please file an issue. If you've got a
feature request, feel free to ask about it. Please just keep in mind Alacritty
is focused on simplicity and performance, and not all features are in line with
that goal.

Before opening a new issue, please check if it has already been reported.
There's a chance someone else has already reported it, and you can subscribe to
that issue to keep up on the latest developments.

## FAQ

**_Is it really the fastest terminal emulator?_**

In the terminals we've [benchmarked](http://github.com/alacritty/vtebench),
Alacritty is either faster or **way** faster than the others. If you've found a
case where this isn't true, please report a bug.

**_Why isn't feature X implemented?_**

Alacritty has many great features, but not every feature from every other
terminal. This could be for a number of reasons, but sometimes it's just not a
good fit for Alacritty. This means you won't find things like tabs or splits
(which are best left to a window manager or [terminal multiplexer][tmux]) nor
niceties like a GUI config editor.
