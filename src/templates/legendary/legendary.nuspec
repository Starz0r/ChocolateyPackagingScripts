    <description>
Legendary is an open-source game launcher that can download and install games from the Epic Games platform on Linux and Windows.
It's name as a tongue-in-cheek play on tiers of [item rarity in many MMORPGs](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Quality).

Right now Legendary is in beta and not feature-complete. You might run into some bugs or issues.
If you do please [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/derrod/legendary/issues/new) so we can fix it.

**What works:**
 - Authenticating with Epic's service
 - Downloading and installing your games and their DLC
 - Delta patching/updating of installed games
 - Launching games with online authentication (for multiplayer/DRM)
 - Syncing cloud saves (compatible with EGL)
 - Running games with WINE on Linux
 - Importing/Exporting installed games from/to the Epic Games Launcher

**Planned:**
 - Simple GUI for managing/launching games
 - Better interfaces for other developers to use Legendary in their projects
 - Lots and lots of bug fixes, optimizations, and refactoring...
 
## Maintainer Notice
Anti-virus, anti-malware, and heuristic engines might catch and label this software as a threat. While I retain the notion that this is indeed a false positive caused by [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/), this is a proper warning given ahead-of-time. If you use any of these security products then you'd would likely need to disable them temporarily to allow install, or add an exception for the software.
