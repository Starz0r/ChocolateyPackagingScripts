VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.
 
1. Go to https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls/tree/$tag

2. Clone or download the repository

3. Install Visual Studio 2019 + C/C++ Build Tools, CMake, and optionally LLVM for the LLD linker and Ninja.
	My build environment used:
		Visual Studio 2019 16.10.2
		Microsoft Visual Studio Compiler v142
		CMake 3.21.1
		LLVM 12.0.1
		Ninja 1.10.2
	
	If you choose to not install LLVM and prefer using the native system linker, remember to remove `-DCMAKE_LINKER="lld-link"` from the CMake command.
	Same with ninja, you can just remove `-G Ninja`, and CMake will default to using Visual Studio.
	
4. Make a new folder in the project root called `build` and enter it.

5. Download https://ziglang.org/deps/llvm+clang-7.0.0-win64-msvc-release.tar.xz and unarchive it in that folder.

6. Run `cmake .. -BRelease -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G Ninja -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<replace with project root>\build\llvm+clang-7.0.0-win64-msvc-release -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER="cl.exe" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="cl.exe" -DCMAKE_LINKER="lld-link"`

7. Enter the `Release` folder.

8. Build the application by running `ninja`.
